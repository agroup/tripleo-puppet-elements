# Idempotent script to apply heat configuration to the running network
# environment.
#
# If a bootstrap public_interface_ip is defined in metadata and not attached to
# any device then it will be added to the public_interface device if one is
# defined.
#
# An integration bridge for neutron-ovs-agent is created.
#
# If no physical bridge is defined in metadata, the script will have no
# further effect.
#
# If the defined physical_bridge is not present on the system, one will be
# defined via ovs-vsctl.
#
# The physical bridge will be brought up.
#
# If a public_interface is defined in metadata:
#   - it will be made a member of the physical_bridge.
#   - an ip addresses on public_interface are moved onto physical_bridge.
#
# An iptables rule to redirect incoming metadata server requests on the public
# bridge device is inserted if not present.
#
# Note that no persistent config file is written to the OS : ovs-vsctl modifies
# a persistent database so the bridge device will persist across reboots, but
# [on Ubuntu at least] early boot does not bring up ovs-vswitch early enough,
# and metadata access will fail.
